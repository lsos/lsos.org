### Enjoyment

We enjoy our work. With enjoyment we mean the following: if you’d receive 10 million dollars tomorrow, would you stop working? If not then we consider that you enjoy your work.

### Impact

We enjoy our work because we intimately know that what we do has a positive impact. To us, work is always a means to impact. We look for people that intuitively maximize impact (instead of maximizing praise and recognition).

### Confidence

We are confident because our experience has shown that we are able to achieve audacious goals. We call this “true” confidence: not an inborn confidence but one that has been gained through experience. We look for people that espouse bold goals and drastic solutions.

### Transparency

Major decisions and their rationale are written down and made available to each member of the Lsos, mitigating self-interests.

### Work–life balance

To the question whether working with us makes you happy, the answer should be yes most of the time.
If the answer is no all too often then we talk about it.
You need a break? That's fine, just let us know how long you'll be away.
You want to reduce your hours? That's (usually) also fine; most of our jobs are available as part-time positions.
It is our experience that satisfaction leads to sustained effectiveness.

### Keeper test

We believe in the “keeper test”: if someone was thinking of leaving us, would we try to keep them from leaving? If someone doesn’t pass the keeper test then we openly discuss the problems and try to find a solution.
Those for whom we can’t find a solution are given a severance package. We see employment as a professional symbiosis where both employee and employer blossom. The keeper test is a prerequisite for mutual blossoming.

### Great Team

Hiring only great people leads to contagious enjoyment and focus; being part of a great team can be the thrill of a professional lifetime.

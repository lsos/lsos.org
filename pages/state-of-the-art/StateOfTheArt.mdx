<TableRef>
<>Proprietary | Closed Source</>
<>
closed sourced, not forkable, usually expensive.
Photoshop, Windows, AutoCAD, etc.

<TableRef>

<>
same, but the code is available to be read.
Unreal Engine, for example,
shares knowledge and benefits community patches
by making its code public.
</>

<TableRef>
<>Open Source | Open Core</>
<>
the code is open source but some extensions are proprietary.
Such Software can in theory be as expensive as proprietary software but they are usually more accessible.
Elasticsearch is a successful example of using the open core model to build a prosperous company.
</>
</TableRef>
<TableRef>
<>Open Source | Dual Licensing</>
<>
the code is available as a
"community version" with a free but restrictive copyleft license,
and as an "enterprise version" with a permissive but paid commercial license.
For example, MongoDB's community version is
AGPL-like licensed and prohibits running a SaaS,
while the enterprise version allows running a SaaS but is very expensive.
This is not particularly forkable: if MongoDB shuts down
then the code is stuck with the restrictive license and
nobody can take over.
</>
</TableRef>

<TableRef>
<>Open Source | Company Backed</>
<>
large companies are increasingly open sourcing their internal tools.
These projects are open source and financed but not independent.
React's development, for example, is entirely dependent on Facebook.
</>
</TableRef>

<TableRef>
<>Open Source | Donations</>
<>
some projects &mdash;
due to their high exposure, high amount of users, and relatively low developing cost &mdash;
can sustain solely on donations.
Usually in web development, for example Webpack or Vue.
For most projects donations are not enough.

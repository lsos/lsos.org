## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we
pledge to making participation in the Lsos and
our community a constructive experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Insulting/derogatory comments and personal attacks
* Harassment
* Publishing others' private information

## Our Responsibilities

We are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and we take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

We have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that we deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within Lsos spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the Lsos or its community. Examples of
representing the Lsos or community include using an official Lsos e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.
